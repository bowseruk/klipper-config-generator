# Klipper Config Generator

![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-brightgreen.svg)

## Description

This project is designed to make the process of making a config file for Klipper easier.

I wanted to make this after frustration of trying to find the correct pin after modifying config files. I like to tinker with my printers, so I wanted to make something easier to deal with.

The project had the following requirements:

- The printer must be using Klipper.

- The printer must be on the tool. I will accept pull requests with details on new printers, but I will not maintain any printers I do not own.

- The boards used must be on the tool. Again I will accept requests, but I will not maintain any boards I do not own.
